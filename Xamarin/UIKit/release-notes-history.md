The Syncfusion Essential UI Kit is a collection of easy-to-use, extendable, and adaptable XAML templates that allows you to quickly create a Xamarin.Forms application by providing generic pre-defined screens. Now, the UI Kit has screens for the following categories:

* ECommerce
* Chat
* Feedback
* Contact us
* About Us
* Article
* Navigation
* Error and Empty


## UI Kit version 1.0.0.1 


The screens can be added in your application by the following two ways: 

1. Using **XAML UI Kit for Xamarin.Forms** Visual Studio extension.

2. Copying the files from our open source [GitHub repository](https://github.com/syncfusion/essential-ui-kit-for-xamarin.forms).
