# Syncfusion Xamarin Forms UI Design 

The UI Kit offers a set of easy-to-use, extendable, and adaptable XAML UI pages crafted for Xamarin.Forms applications. These pages cover the most generic mobile, desktop, and tablet UI patterns, and are designed for enhancing the end-user experience.

## Easy Integration

The pages can be integrated in Xamarin applications by just setting up the navigation among the XAML pages and updating the business logic in the view models.
 
## Phones, Tablets, and Desktops

The XAML pages are tested on various screen sizes. The pages are adaptable to landscape and portrait modes in mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
 
## MVVM Design Pattern

The XAML pages are designed with MVVM pattern, ensuring a clean separation between the UI and the application logic.
 
## Completely Open Source

Users will get full access to the complete code base. The UI Kit is maintained in a public GitHub repository as completely open source under an MIT license.
 
## Custom Branding

You can easily edit the logo, background image, fonts, and a lot more by changing a few lines of code. The pages in the UI Kit have different styles and themes for every XAML element that can be easily modified.
