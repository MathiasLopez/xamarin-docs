# Syncfusion XAML Pages for Xamarin.Forms

The Syncfusion Essential UI Kit is a collection of easy-to-use, extendable, and adaptable XAML pages that allows you to quickly create a Xamarin.Forms application by providing generic pre-defined screens. Now, the UI Kit has screens for the following categories:

* Login
* ECommerce
* Chat
* Feedback
* Contact Us
* About Us
* Article
* Navigation
* Error and Empty

The screens are developed with MVVM pattern, which separates the UI and business logic results in a clean, professional, and scalable representation of user interface in your Xamarin.Forms applications. You can get the UI Kit application from [Google Play Store] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.syncfusion.xamarin.uikit) and the complete source code is available in [GitHub repository](https://github.com/syncfusion/essential-ui-kit-for-xamarin.forms)
