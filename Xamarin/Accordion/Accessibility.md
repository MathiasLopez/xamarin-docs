# Automation Id

The Accordion control has built in AutomationId for inner elements. Please find following table of AutomationIds of inner elements. To keep unique 
AutomationID, These inner element's Automation IDs get updated based on Accordion's Automation ID. For example, if we set Accordion's AutomationId as
"Accordion.AutomationId = Automation" then Automation framework will intract the `Accordion` as `AutomationItem1 Expander`. The following
image denoted the AutomationIds of inner elements.
