# Overview

The Essential Xamarin Carousel allows the viewer to view several images of products across a row, and they can swipe horizontally across the row to navigate to the next set of products.
The Carousel control is a circular conveyor on which objects are displayed and rotated. They provide a 2-D interface for displaying objects with interactive navigation.

Essential Carousel also works for a wide variety of device sizes and screen resolutions.

Key Featues:

* Offset - It is used to specify the space between the un selected items in Carousel.
* Rotation Angle - It is used to rotate all the items to a specified angle.
* Duration - It is used to specify the time taken to move an item to the selected item position
