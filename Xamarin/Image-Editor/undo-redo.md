# Undo and Redo

One of the important features of the image editor control is to perform `Undo` and `Redo` operations for adding shapes, text, and drawing paths. 

## Undo

The `Undo` method is used to revert the changes done previously over an image.

Undo can be performed for the following operations:

* Add/delete shapes or text.
* Change positions.
* Color/fill changes.
* Path drawings.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}

editor.Undo();

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}

## Redo

The `Redo` method is used to redo the changes that are reverted by undo operation.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}

editor.Redo();

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}

N> Undo and redo cannot be applied for cropping and transformations.
