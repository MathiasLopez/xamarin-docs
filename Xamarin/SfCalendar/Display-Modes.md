# View of SfCalendar

SfCalendar control provides two types of views to display dates such as month view and year view. It can be assigned to the SfCalendar control by using `ViewMode` property.Based on the userâ€™s preference SfCalendar can be viewed in any of the available two types.

N> By default SfCalendar control is assigned with month view. 

## MonthView

This displays entire dates of a particular month, by default current month will be displayed on loading. The current date is provided with separate color different from the rest of the dates color in a month. The events availability will be denoted within the cell based on its duration.

The dates in month view can be selected by three ways such as single, multiple and range which can be modified using `SelectionMode`

### Customization of SfCalendar's dates in MonthView

We can customize the calendar view in monthView mode by using `MonthViewSettings`. 

* Current day text color can be modified using `TodayTextColor`.

* It also has API `MonthLabelSettings` to change the date text size, day text size and format options.

* The background color of the inline view can be modified using `InlineBackgroundColor` property.

* The BlackOutDate color can be modified with `BlackOutColor` property.

SfCalendar calendar = new SfCalendar();    

MonthLabelSettings labelSettings = new MonthLabelSettings();
labelSettings.DateFormat = "dd";
labelSettings.DayLabelSize = 20;
labelSettings.DayFormat = "EEE";
labelSettings.DateLabelSize = 12;

MonthViewSettings monthViewSettings = new MonthViewSettings();
monthViewSettings.CurrentMonthBackgroundColor = Color.FromHex("#800080");
monthViewSettings.CurrentMonthTextColor = Color.FromHex("#ffffff");
monthViewSettings.PreviousMonthBackgroundColor = Color.FromHex("#9895F0");
monthViewSettings.PreviousMonthTextColor = Color.FromHex("#000000");
monthViewSettings.DateSelectionColor = Color.FromHex("#ffffff");
monthViewSettings.SelectedDayTextColor = Color.FromHex("#000000");

monthViewSettings.MonthLabelSettings = labelSettings;
calendar.MonthViewSettings = monthViewSettings;

this.Content = calendar;
