# Overview

SfLinearGauge displays a range of values graphically along the linear scale. It is considered as the linear form of the CircularGauge. It measures the values of the scale and it is present in the horizontal or vertical sliding or meter. SfLinearGauge is used to identify the quantitative values in analog format. It is rendered as a canvas image. By using the SfLinearGauge control, it is possible to render the thermometer.
